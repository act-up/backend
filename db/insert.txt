These workers are on the front lines of the disease. Over the course of a single shift, they are exposed to countless people who may be infected--whether customers, co-workers, or someone in the supply chain--thereby increasing the risk to their own well being, as well as anyone else they come in contact with. These workers are unable to follow any-shelter at-home mandate, because their jobs are simply too important. Their pay should reflect this. A one-time bonus is not enough. A very small increase is not enough. These workers are people with full lives and loved ones, who are putting their lives at risk doing a job that our society needs done in order to function. It is your responsibility as an employer to provide a safe work environment for your employees, as well as for your customers. \n I implore you to do the right thing and provide your employees with hazard pay, protective equipment, and appropriate sick leave. Your customers stand with your workers.",
